## Description

This repository contains the codebase for the "Tab Pages" application, a web-based application designed for creating, managing and organizing browser tabs. Built with TypeScript and React, the application ensures high performance and a user-friendly interface.

"Tab Pages" is a testament to modern web application development and best practices. With the help of React's powerful capabilities, this application provides an intuitive and seamless experience for managing browser tabs. Utilizing Redux for state management, the application ensures consistent performance and an organized data flow. Also, the application heavily uses styled-components for CSS-in-JS solutions, allowing a highly flexible and dynamic styling of components.

1. **Tab Management**: Create, edit, delete, and rearrange tabs as desired for easy navigation and organization.

2. **Grouping Tabs**: Group related tabs together for an easy and efficient browsing experience.

3. **Saving Groups**: Save groups of tabs for later use, enabling users to switch between tasks efficiently.

4. **Import and Export Tabs**: Import or export tabs or groups of tabs as JSON files for sharing or backup.

5. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Rearrange tabs and groups easily with a simple drag-and-drop interface.
